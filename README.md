Dex Office Suite is a All in One, Free, Light Weight, High Efficiency Application Suite that provides loads of features that are but not limited to Optical Character Recognition, Document Scanning and much more.
<br><br>


Dex Office Suite in no way captures any sort of user data. To prove this,
   - Open the app's Manifest:
      - <i>app -> src-> main -> AndroidMainfest.xml</i><br>
      There would be no Internet Permissions granted there (Android is very strict about permissions)
<br>    
    
Dex Office Suite also has a Voice Assistant that is still under development that makes navigating around the app much much easier. Simple say something like "Scan this Image" and the Document Scanner will open up
<br><br>

The application also has a "Dark Mode" that changes the entire theme of the application.

Currently, Dex Office Suite provides you with the following features:
   - <b>Optical Character Recognition</b>: Extract Text From Images
   - <b>Document Scanning</b>: Convert Images to PDF format
   - <b>Canvas</b>: Helpful to draw your mind or express something
